## Non-functional Requirements


- Requirements which don't specify what the system will do, but rather how the system will perform the behaviors. 

- There are many, many non-functional requirements for a system. Many of them revolve around process or quality attributes you're seeking to instill in a project.

- Process requirements may be things like mandating a particular case system, that is, a computer-assisted software engineering tool like Microsoft Project or Jira, a bug-tracking software. Or it might have to do with the programming language the team will be using or the development method.

- These are often design constraints. For example, one employer I worked for earlier in my career created a site license for IBM development tools and server software. 

- In that scenario, whatever solution we built had to use DB2 as its database platform because that was the IBM DB2 system. There was no argument to be made. That contract was purchased long before the project started and the company wasn't going to spend any additional money for other database software.

- Software quality is also something that takes on importance at the very beginning. Security, performance, usability. These are things that every system needs. 

- It can't be completely slow or completely unusable or horribly insecure. Some baseline amount of each of these things is necessary and usually cheap to make happen. 

- But some of these are going to be judged as more important than the others, and a conflict is always there. 

- Online finance applications, like online banking, often prioritize security over usability. 

- Think about two-factor authentication, which has been gaining popularity in recent years. Is it easier to use? No, but it's far more secure. That's the trade-off. 

- So, these are the things that you have to worry about when you're defining what your system's going to do. So let's take a closer look at three classifications of non-functional requirements. Product, organization and external.

- Product requirements which are non-functional talk about specific behavior. 

- This is often in the form of protocol requirements, encodings, or encryption requirements, that sort of thing. They are requirements on the product itself.

- Product requirements that are also non-functional talk about specific behavior. This is often in the form of protocol requirements, encodings and encryption requirements, that sort of thing. 

- Things that are required about the product from a non-functional standpoint.

- Organizational requirements are those that are defined by the company. Company standards, your development team's code style requirements, even the development process itself like using Scrum could be defined as something like this.

- And then external constraints are a big factor especially in regulated industries. 

- When the FAA says you have to use this development process or meet these code coverage testing metrics, that's all there is to it. 

- You have to. And if they change, you have to change. This is the kind of control we're talking about, being impacted by external entities. That's something you want to document early on in the process.

- So, non-functional requirements are a very important piece of this entire process. It's very important on nearly every project you need to be sure to consider them separately from functionality. 

- You need to take time and consider each individual non-functional requirement that you're looking at, making sure that you've met those metrics when you go forward in the process. And you want to make sure that you do that for every project.



## Notes

1. Non-functional requirements
    1. Define system properties and constraints
    2. Process requirements
    3. Often more critical than functional requirements

2. Non-functional classifications
    1. Product requirements (requirements which spesify that delivered product must behave in a particular way)
       Example: it shall be possible for all necessary communication between the ATM and the user to be expressed in the standar ASCII character set.
    2. Organization Requirements (requirements which are a consequence of organizational policies and procedures)
       Example: the system development process and deliverable documents shall conform to the process and deliverables defined in XYZCo-SP-STAN-95.
    3. External requirements (requirements which arise from factors which are external to the system and its development process)
       Example: The system shall use a file format readable by MS-Word 6.0 and 2000.

3. Non-functional requirements keys:
    1. Never to be overlocked!
    2. Very important on nearly every project
    3. Be sure to consider them separately from the functionality
    4. Consider each classification separately
